I am a developmental psychologist

Desirée is a neuroscientist

Neither of us is a web developer

But we both ship a lot of websites for teaching data science.

Here are just a few of them.

All of these links are clickable from the slides.

Each site was built using R Markdown, with different tools chosen depending on what we needed.
